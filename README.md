Legend:
- "AiB's Gno tech staff" is the combination of Gno dedicated developers + lead from other AiB tech products + devrels + tokenomics.
- Core contributors is the combination of the "AiB's Gno tech staff" + notable contributors + tech partners + grantees.

TODOs
- weekly us staff sync
- review syncs
- office hours
- consider switching all private meetings to public in some way, i.e., by sharing the outcome publicly.
- use a machine-readable format, then generate this part of the markdown? could allow generating other formats (.ics?) and ease PR reviews.

### Bi-weekly public core sync

> Lead: Michelle
> Schedule: Wednesdays (2/2); UTC=3pm PST=8am CET=5PM

_TODO: add useful info on events & records_

### Weekly GH review meeting ([meta issue](https://github.com/gnolang/meetings/issues/18))

> Lead: Manfred or Jae
> Schedule: Thursdays; UTC=4pm PST=9am CET=6PM

We will hold weekly review meetings, with potential exceptions depending on circumstances. All technical staff are encouraged to participate whenever feasible. 

**Meeting Process**:
1. **Preparation**: Before the meeting, participants are expected to update their own PRs/issues and glance over others'. 
2. **Leading**: One participant will spearhead the session by sharing their screen, facilitating collaborative discussion and review.
3. **Commenting**: Feedback should be shared directly within the context of the PRs or issues under review. 
4. **Meta-Issues**: After the meeting, we will update a designated meta-issue with links to the items reviewed during the session, following [this example](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33892).

We will use [this board](https://github.com/orgs/gnolang/projects/4/views/1?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) as our starting point for issue/PR selection, but exploring other repositories and identifying pertinent issues is also encouraged.
This process allows us to stay up-to-date and have dynamic discussions on relevant topics.
