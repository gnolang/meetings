TODOs
- weekly us staff sync
- review syncs
- office hours
- consider switching all private meetings to public in some way, i.e., by sharing the outcome publicly.
- use a machine-readable format, then generate this part of the markdown? could allow generating other formats (.ics?) and ease PR reviews.

### Weekly review meeting

We'll have weekly review meetings, with the possibility of occasional skips. Tech staff are encouraged to join whenever possible. Prior to the meeting, participants are requested to warm up by reviewing PRs, commenting, and updating relevant issues and PRs. At the end of the meeting, we'll share a list of discussions and status similar to [this example](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33892).

We can utilize [this board](https://github.com/orgs/gnolang/projects/4/views/1?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) as a starting point, but we should also explore other repositories and search for relevant issues. During the meeting, the lead should share their screen for collaborative discussions while reviewing the shared content.

## Ponctual meetings and events

TODO: workshops, brainstorming sessions, events, ...
