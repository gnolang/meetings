TODOs
- weekly us staff sync
- review syncs
- office hours
- consider switching all private meetings to public in some way, i.e., by sharing the outcome publicly.
- use a machine-readable format, then generate this part of the markdown? could allow generating other formats (.ics?) and ease PR reviews.

## Ponctual meetings and events
